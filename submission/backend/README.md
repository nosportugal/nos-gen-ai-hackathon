# Backend

Python pipeline that masks sensitive data in a PDF, one `*` per word.

```
document.pdf ──extract_text()──▶ text (one line per PDF line, no empty lines)
                                   │
          prompt.txt + numbered text ──Gemini──▶ spans.json  {"spans": [{line, text, category, reason}]}
                                   │                │
                                   └──────mask()────┘──▶ masked text: every word of a span becomes "*"
```

The model only *points* at sensitive text; the masking is done in code, so
lines, spacing and every other word stay byte for byte the same.

## Setup

```bash
cd submission/backend
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Python >= 3.10
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env                                  # add your GEMINI_API_KEY
```

## Usage

```bash
# Mask a document (calls Gemini once; the answer is cached in .cache/)
python -m anonymizer ../../raw_data/document_to_anonymize.pdf -o out.txt

# Same, keeping the model's exact answer and the run details in a folder
python -m anonymizer ../../raw_data/document_to_anonymize.pdf \
    --save-run ../outputs -o ../submission.txt

# Reproduce the output from that folder, without the API
python -m anonymizer ../../raw_data/document_to_anonymize.pdf \
    --from-run ../outputs -o out.txt
```

`--save-run DIR` writes:

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `spans.json` | the JSON the model returned, exactly as returned |
| `run.json` | model, `prompt.txt` hash, document hash and line count, timestamp |

The final `submission/submission.txt` is produced with `--save-run
submission/outputs`, so the judges can follow document → prompt → model
answer → `*`, and anyone can replay it with `--from-run`.

## API (for the Angular frontend)

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --port 8000 --reload
```

Implements [`../frontend/API_CONTRACT.md`](../frontend/API_CONTRACT.md):

| Endpoint | Does |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/documents/analyze` (multipart `file`) | PDF → text → Gemini detection → one entity per occurrence with UTF-16 offsets |
| `POST /api/documents/{id}/anonymize` (`{"selectedEntityIds": [...]}`) | masks only the selected occurrences and returns the preview text plus the download in base64: the uploaded PDF rebuilt with those words redacted (`pdf_reconstructor`), or the masked `.txt` if the PDF cannot be rebuilt safely |

Analyses live in memory for one hour. Errors come back as `{"message": "..."}`
with the contract's status codes (400, 404, 413, 415, 422, 500). CORS allows
`http://localhost:4200`; with the Angular proxy no CORS is needed at all.

## Deploy (Render)

One Docker image serves both the API and the built Angular app, so the whole
app lives on one URL and needs no CORS. `submission/Dockerfile` builds the
frontend with Node, then runs `uvicorn` with the build in `backend/static`.
`GET /api/health` is there for the platform's health check.

```bash
# Locally (from the repository root)
docker build -t dataveil submission
docker run -p 10000:10000 --env-file submission/backend/.env dataveil
# -> http://localhost:10000
```

On [Render](https://render.com): **New -> Web Service**, connect this fork,
then:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Branch | `team_HTTPERROR469` (every merge redeploys) |
| Language | Docker |
| Root directory | `submission` |
| Dockerfile path | `./Dockerfile` (relative to the root directory) |
| Docker build context directory | `.` (relative to the root directory) |
| Instance type | Free |
| Health check path | `/api/health` |
| Environment | `GEMINI_API_KEY` (a key made only for the demo), `GEMINI_MODEL` |

- The key is set in Render's environment only; `.dockerignore` keeps `.env`
  out of the image.
- Keep one instance and one worker: analyses live in memory between
  `/analyze` and `/anonymize`.
- On the free plan the service sleeps after ~15 min idle and the first
  request takes about a minute: open the link a few minutes before a demo.
- Gemini's free tier may use what is sent to improve Google's products:
  upload fictitious documents only (like the challenge's).

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest -q      # no API calls
cd ../.. && flake8 .     # same check as the CI workflow
```
