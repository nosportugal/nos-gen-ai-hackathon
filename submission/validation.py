Compare the original document with the anonymized document below.
Score from 0 to 100 how well the anonymized document preserves the original
document's context, meaning, and structure. A score of 100 means the content
is fully preserved apart from appropriate anonymization. A score of 0 means
the content is not preserved. Masked sensitive words represented by one or
