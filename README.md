# NOS Gen-AI Hackathon

Welcome to the official repository for the NOS Gen-AI Hackathon, part of the SCAILE initiative! In this repository, you will find essential resources including the official hackathon rules, code snippets, and examples designed to facilitate your development process. Additionally, we provide a baseline structure to guide you in addressing the proposed challenge effectively.

## 0. Problem Statement and Evaluation Criteria

For a complete description of the problem statement and the detailed evaluation criteria, refer to this [document](tutorials/problem_and_eval.md).

The document to be anonymized is located at [`raw_data/document_to_anonymize.pdf`](raw_data/document_to_anonymize.pdf).

## 1. Prerequisites

Before participating in the hackathon, please ensure that you meet the following prerequisites. Having the needed accounts and accesses will help streamline your development process and facilitate the use of necessary tools and APIs.

### 1.1. GitHub Account

Make sure you have an active GitHub account at [Create a GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup)

### 1.2. Google Account

You'll need an active Google account to access Google AI tools at [Create a Google Account](https://accounts.google.com/signup)

### 1.3. Set Up Your Google API Key

To generate your API key:

a. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) and log in with your Google account.  
b. Click on the **‚ÄúGet API Key‚Äù** button.  
c. Select **‚ÄúCreate API key‚Äù** (or **‚ÄúCriar chave de API‚Äù** if in Portuguese).  
d. A window will open where you‚Äôll create an API key under a new project.  
e. **Important:** Save the generated API key in a safe place ‚Äî you'll need it later!

## 2. Setup

In this section, we'll walk you through the essential setup steps needed to get started with your project. Follow these instructions carefully!

### 2.1. Git tutorial

If you're new to Git, it‚Äôs important to understand how to manage your code effectively. To help you get started, we have provided a Git tutorial at [Git Tutorial](tutorials/git_tutorial.md). This tutorial will guide you through the fundamental concepts and commands you'll need to commit your changes and collaborate with your team.

## 3. Utils

This section contains helpful resources and tools to support your work.

### 3.1. Getting Started with Gemini API

If you're looking for **detailed steps**, including how to obtain an API key and example usage, please refer to the full tutorial at [Gemini 2.0 Tutorial](tutorials/gemini_tutorial.md)

### 3.2. Document Conversion Methods

Converting PDF documents to text can be essential for leveraging existing content in your project. There are methods and tools available for this conversion, which you can explore in detail in the [PDF to Text Guide](tutorials/pdf__to__txt.ipynb).

## 4. Submission Guidelines

In this section, we will outline the expectations for project submission. Understanding these guidelines is crucial to ensure your work is evaluated correctly. There are specific methods and criteria for submission, which you should follow closely to enhance your chances of success. Make sure to read through the following points carefully.
For more detailed information on the submission process and what is expected, please refer to the [Submission Process Guide](submission/README.md).

## üîë API Key Management

To ensure the security of your API key, please follow these guidelines:

- Do not hardcode your API key in your code.

- When you run the notebook for the first time, you will be prompted to enter your API key via an input box.

- The key will be securely saved in a file named API_key.iml (note the capital letters).

## Requirements

- pip install -r requirements.txt to install the required packages.

## Notes:

- The folder page_drag_and_drop is a drag-and-drop interface for uploading files. It is not fully operational yet, but it is a work in progress.
